## Introduction

On July 18th, Stretch LTS started, offering two more years of security support
to the Debian Stretch release. Stretch LTS is the fourth iteration of LTS,
following Squeeze LTS which started in 2014, Wheezy LTS in 2016, and Jessie
LTS in 2018.

However, for the first time, we prepared a small survey about our users and
contributors, who they are and why they are using LTS. This page compiles the
results of that very survey. 


## Quick Statistics

- Number of questions: 14
- Survey duration: 2 weeks
- Survey start date: July 13th, 2020
- Survey end date: July 27th, 2020
- Total responses: 1764
  - Complete responses: 892
  - Incomplete responses: 872

**NOTE**: “Incomplete responses” are the surveys that the user started fulfilling
  and then went to another place saving for later or even not saving, i.e., data
  stored but without the user clicking the “submit” button. “Complete responses”
  are the surveys that the user sent by clicking the “submit” button (they can
  include some unanswered questions, if they were optional).  
  More info at [https://manual.limesurvey.org/Responses](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Responses).


## Responses

We’ve got an overwhelming response from the survey. Below are the compiled
responses and the stats. 

### Objective Questions

11 out of 14 questions were objective in nature. They are statistically represented
